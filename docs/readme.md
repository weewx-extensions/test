## Description

This is a template `readme` file.
It is meant to be used both in the repository display and the github pages.
This file is included from an `index.md` file in github pages.
It is displayed 'as-is' in the repository.
This means it must be 'native' markdown (or html).
Therefore the 'footer' is included directly in this file.
And the `index.md` file for github pages 'turns off the footer'.

**When using, remmber to update the URLs in the 'footer' and in 'additional information' below.**
